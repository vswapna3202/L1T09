# L1T09 : This program works on String Handling

This program reads a string from the user and makes each alternate character upper case character and each other alternate character as lower case.
e.g. The string “Hello World” would become “HeLlO WoRlD”
Now the same string is used to start with lower case and then alternate character as upper case.
e.g. The string: “I am learning to code” would become “i AM learning TO
code”.

split and join functions are used in the code to achieve this.
